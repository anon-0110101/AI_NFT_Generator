# AI_NFT_Generator
# Ethereum-backed AI-NFT Generator
Welcome to the Ethereum-backed AI-NFT Generator, a project that merges the power of Ethereum, artificial intelligence, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) into a unique and innovative web experience. Crafted by a proficient web developer mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, SCrypt, Solidity, and React.js, this project allows users to generate AI-generated images, store them as IPFS files, and mint them as NFTs by connecting their Web3 wallets.

# Project Overview
# Technologies Used
Solidity: Writing smart contracts to manage the creation and minting of NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.
JavaScript/HTML: Developing the front end to interact with users and handle the image generation process.
AI Image Generator API: Utilizing an AI-powered image generator API to transform user-inputted words into unique images.
IPFS: Storing generated images as IPFS files for decentralized and secure storage.
Web3 Integration: Allowing users to connect their Web3 wallets for secure transactions and NFT minting.
# Features
AI Image Generation: Users input words to generate unique images using an AI image generator API.

IPFS Storage: Generated images are stored securely on the decentralized IPFS network.

Web3 Wallet Connection: Users can connect their Web3 wallets for secure identity verification.

NFT Minting: Pay a fee to mint NFT versions of generated images on the Ethereum blockchain.

# How to Use
Generate AI Image: Input words and generate a unique image using the AI image generator.
